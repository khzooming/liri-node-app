This liri app will answer your questions for certain subjects including Movie Search, Song Title Search, Upcoming Concert times for bands, and a Surprise Song Search from a hidden text file.

Initial instructions:
Using the terminal, open up the liri folder from GitHub.
Once you are in the liri folder, install the required Node modules using "npm install"

1) Check upcoming concert tickets for your favorite band!
In the terminal, type the following:
        node liri.js concert-this
    
    and then enter the name of your band.  In the example below we are using Paul McCartney.

2) Learn more about your favorite songs!
In the terminal, type the following:
        node liri.js spotify-this-song
    
    and then enter the name of your song title.  In the example below we are using the song "FourFiveSeconds" by Paul McCartney and Rihanna.  If you enter song titles with spaces, it's necessary to add underscore between the words where the spaces would typically go.

    Once we hit enter, the artist name, song title, and a preview link for the song are displayed.

3) Check out details for a movie of your choice.
In the terminal, type the following:
        node liri.js movie-this
        
 and then enter the movie title.  Add Underscore to cover any spaces between your words.
 
 
 
 Once we hit enter, lots of info about the movie is printed out including:
        Title of the movie
        Year the movie came out
        IMDB Rating of the movie
        Rotton Tomatoes Rating of the movie
        Country where the movie was produced
        Language of the Movie
        Plot of the movie
        Actors in the movie
        
4) The last step our program does is to do a mystery song.  
In the terminal, type the following:
        node liri.js do-what-it-says
        
 Once we hit enter, this search was for a song called "I want it that way" by the Backstreet Boys.
 
 Thanks for using the liri app, I hope you had fun!
